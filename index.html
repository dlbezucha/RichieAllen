                <p class="copy">Rockaway residents had every reason to avoid the beach this weekend—between the hate speech that appeared in the sand over Labor Day and the beach closures due to Hurricane Dorian.</p>
                <p class="copy">But they showed up to surf and remember one of their own at the 15th Annual Richie Allen Memorial Surf Classic.</p>
                <p class="copy">Allen, 31, was a New York City firefighter who lost his life rescuing victims from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. This annual surf competition brings together family and friends to honor Allen in exactly the way he would have wanted: by riding some waves.</p>
                <p class="copy">“His absolute love was the beach,” said Luke Allen, Richie’s brother. “This competition is the perfect way of remembering his spirit.”</p>

                </div>
                <p class="copy">The day includes a surf competition for kids 16 and under, music, food, a visit from a New York City Fire Department boat, and a memorial paddle out. Allen’s family sells t-shirts each year to raise funds to keep the event going and to help a local family with medical bills.</p>
                <p class="copy">“The Allen family is phenomenal and very supportive of kids,” said Oleg Gershkovich, who has been coming to the event with his son for the past five years. “This is the greatest turnout ever. It’s a testament to how solid the Allens are in the community, and it’s a really great way to remember his life.”</p>
                <p class="copy">In addition to working as a firefighter, Allen was a teacher, a school bus driver, and a lifeguard on Rockaway and Riis beaches. The event takes place at Beach 91st Street, where Allen used to lifeguard and surf, a spot renamed Richie Allen’s Way in his honor.</p>

                <p class="copy">“He always put others before himself,” said Gail Allen, Richie’s mom. On September 11th, “He would have done the same thing if he had just been walking by on the sidewalk,” she said.</p>
                <p class="copy">Both of Allen’s younger brothers are now firefighters.</p>
                <p class="copy">Richie’s niece, Kailey Aiken, 15, never had a chance to meet her uncle, but she competes in the event every year in his honor.</p>
                <p class="copy">“It’s a nice way for my family to remember him,” said Aiken.</p>
                <p class="copy">Surfing clearly runs in the family.</p>
                <p class="copy">The sun was shining all day long, but this was not unusual. It has only rained once in the 15 years they have been running the event.</p>
                <p class="copy">“He has a lot of pull with the weather,” said Gail, smiling. </p>

                </div>
                <p class="copy">The day ended with a memorial paddle out. Nearly 100 surfers paddled into the ocean carrying red carnations. They formed a large circle out in the water as parents and friends watched from the beach. After a moment of silence and some kind words, everyone tossed their carnations into the water before riding one last wave back to shore.</p>
                <p class="copy">This year the event happened to coincide with the most epic waves in Rockaway Beach history, thanks to Hurricane Dorian. As a precaution, the Parks Department officially closed the beach for two days, but this did not stop local surfers. The police were called when several surfers refused to get out of the water. </p>
                <p class="copy">When asked if Richie would have been among them, Gail Allen said, “He would have been the first one in.”</p>
